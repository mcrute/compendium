# Michael Crute

**Last Updated:** 2021-08-15

Hello, I'm Mike and this repository serves as an supplementary index of the
tech and open source projects to/for which I maintain, lead, or contribute.

At some point in the past SourceForge and then GitHub were the primary
locations where people collaborated on open source projects but lately this
ecosystem has become more fragmented with the rise of GitLab and self-hosted
forges. As this has happened I find myself often contributing to projects
outside of GitHub yet still use GitHub somewhat as a coding home-page.
Hopefully this compendium will serve useful as an index into other
contributions outside of the GitHub ecosystem.

As always my [website](https://mike.crute.us), though often dated, is
authoritative for my work.

As a worker in "big tech" I feel obligated to say that everything here is for
my own enjoyment and does not reflect anything of or about my employers past,
present, or future.

## Sites

* [code.crute.us](https://code.crute.us) - This is my self-hosted forge and the
  primary place I store my projects. There is quite a lot here that I've
  written for various side projects that either didn't seem worth publishing to
  other places or don't want to actively maintain for others. This is where
  you'll find the most recent/fresh code. I typically mirror my other projects
  from other forges to this one as well.
* [Alpine Linux](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/mcrute) - As a maintainer of
  Alpine Linux, this is where you'll find Alpine Linux related contributions.
* [Alpine Linux Cloud](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/cloud) - I am one
  of the primary maintainers of the Alpine Linux cloud images and have several
  repositories here.
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mcrute) - I don't really contribute anything here
  but do have an account.
* [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/u/mcrute/profile/) - I used to contribute
  to several projects on SourceForce but have not been active there in many years.
